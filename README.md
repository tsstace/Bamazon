# Bamazon

This node application allows the user to order items from a curated list of specialty goods in a mock online storefront interface.  The user will be prompted to select from a list of ten available items and enter the quantity desired.  If the quantity onhand is sufficient to fulfill the order, they will receive a success message with their total purchase price and they will be prompted to make another purchase.  If there is not enough inventory available, they will receive an informational message to try again tomorrow and then be prompted to make another purchase.  

All data for the store items is contained in a table stored in mySQL and is displayed and updated in real time.  

# Node packages included:
- inquirer
- mySQL
